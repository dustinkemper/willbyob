### a restaurant website project

An attempt at creating a static website totally from scratch using modern web design practices. Trying to set up a boilerplate/workflow for future design projects.

>The important thing is that I'm learning.

I intend to use:

* SASS, Bourbon, Neat
* Statmic CMS (for easy client updates)
* mobile responsive custom theme
