      <h4>About Will BYOB</h4>
      <p>Chef and Owner Christopher Kearse, and his team, prepare a menu focused on its season, respecting French traditions along with classic and modern techniques to build a dining experience that evokes excitement and emotion.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>About Chef Kearse</h4>
      <p>One of Philadelphia’s most exciting chefs, Christopher Kearse, was born to cook. As the second-oldest of eight children (along with twin brother Michael), Chris was always interested in what was happening in the kitchen, spending hours watching cooking shows while growing up in Levittown. He eventually took over cooking duties for the family, preparing dinner for his parents and seven siblings every night while in high school.</p>
      <img class="chef-pic" src="/img/Chef-Kearse.jpg">
      <p>In September 2000, Chris was in the passenger’s seat of a friend’s car when a drunk driver hit the vehicle. Chris sustained massive damage to his face, requiring doctors to perform a jaw reconstruction, and was unable to eat solid foods for close to two years. Eventually, Chris returned to the kitchen with a new appreciation for good food, and began his culinary education in earnest.</p>
      <p>  After graduating from high school, Chris attended the Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College, graduating in 2005 as valedictorian. Chris then moved to Chicago, and began a campaign to work in some of the country’s most influential kitchens, sending a letter each week to the same 10 chefs in order to get his foot in the door. Thanks to his diligence, Chris was able to land a variety of positions in some of America's top-rated kitchens including Charlie Trotter’s, Tru, Alinea and Thomas Keller’s French Laundry.</p>
      <p> After returning to Philadelphia, Chris worked at Lacroix, Blackfish and Pumpkin, where he spent more than two years as the chef de cuisine.</p>
      <p>In August 2012, Chris opened Will BYOB on East Passyunk Avenue to rave reviews. Chris was recently named “Best New Chef” by Philadelphia Magazine, has been named one of the 2013 Philadelphia Rising Stars by StarChefs, and was a semifinalist for a James Beard Award in 2013 and 2014.</p><br/>
